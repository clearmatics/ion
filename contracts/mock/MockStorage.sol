/*
    Mock Block Store contract

    This mocking contract is used to simulate interactions and asserting certain return data from interaction via other
    contracts being tested. Use as a tool for testing ONLY.

    This is not an accurate representation of a block store contract and should not be used in any way as a
    representation of a block store contract. Please refer to BlockStore.sol and inherit functionality from that base
    contract and see EthereumStore.sol for more implementation details.
